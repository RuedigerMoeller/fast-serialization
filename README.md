fast-serialization
==================

* up to 10 times faster 100% JDK Serialization compatible drop-in replacement (Ok, might be 99% ..). As an example: Lambda Serialization which came with 1.8 worked instantly.
* Android compatible since version >= 2.17 (use ```FSTConfiguration.createAndroidDefaultConfiguration()``` both on server and client side. The configuration object has to be passed into FSTObjectIn/Output constructors)
* OffHeap Maps, Persistent OffHeap maps
* FSTStructs is very similar to IBM's packed objects. Difference is: You can run it with Oracle JDK today.
* optionally en/decode any Serializable object graph to JSON (incl. shared references) (since 2.29) for interop
* Apache 2.0 license since 2.17

### mvn

**note:** maven.org might lag 1 day behind after releasing.

2.0 version
```.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.ruedigermoeller</groupId>
    <artifactId>fst</artifactId>
    <version>2.50</version>
</dependency>
```
**jdk1.6** compatible build of fst 2.x 

```.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.ruedigermoeller</groupId>
    <artifactId>fst</artifactId>
    <version>2.48-jdk-6</version>
</dependency>
```

1.x version (different package name, 1.6 compatible ..). Fixes are not backported anymore, unsupported.
```.xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.ruedigermoeller</groupId>
    <artifactId>fst</artifactId>
    <version>1.63</version>
</dependency>
```

### Who uses FST ?

I am not actively tracking use, maven.org reports more than **12000** downloads from **5000** distinct IP accesses triggered by maven builds world wide per month.

Notable also:

* used in production in [Eurex Exchange](http://www.eurexchange.com/exchange-en/)'s trading back end's middleware
* [JUptr.io](http://www.juptr.io/)'s distributed system / NLP engine uses FST
* Popular Apache Wicket supplementals use FST to speed up Wicket

### how to build 

* master contains dev branch/trunk.
* 1.x contains old version
* The maven build should work out of the box and reproduces the artifact hosted on maven.org
* To use the gradle build, you need to configure the proxy server in settings.properties (or just set empty if you do not sit behind a proxy).

<b>Note</b> that instrumentation done for fst-structs works only if debug info is turned on during compile. Reason is that generating methods at runtime with javassist fails (probably a javassist bug ..). 
<b>This does not affect the serialization implementation. </b>

<b>JDK 1.6 Build</b>
1.x build since v1.62 are still jdk 6 compatible
